# KickoffWP
WordPress customizer out of your way.

## About

KickoffWP is an open-source project aimed at making the WP Customizer easier to build.  Currently, the customizer requires a lot of code that gets written over and over to build customizable sections within WordPress.

Kickoff uses an easy to use interface for developers to quickly build out their customizer settings.  Kickoff delivers an Object-Oriented class for each Customizer section specified by the user.

## How to Use
